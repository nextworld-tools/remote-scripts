# Clone the repository.

# Install a one-shot systemd service to update this cloned repository and run necessary scripts.
#

#
# Manually execute the service once.
#
# (We do not know how long someone's development instance will go before restarting and kicking of
# the one-shot service as intended. This ensures we at least get to a known state.)
